## The mathematical and physical concept that is _featured power_

The term _featured power_ was first devised in 2005 subsequent to experiments with the Model 'F' oscillator and broadcasting apparatus:

In the picture the planar coils (bottom right), computation boards (center), remote cards with subtractive coils (left), and extended inductance and capacitiors (far left), as well as the terrestrial capacitor for experiments as well as an analog SWR meter (top right).

### What is in this repo?

Collection of code used to compute properties of wireless power and other esoteric oscillators.

The folders marked "comsol" and "matlab" are code files for plots appearing in the paper:

"A contribution to the wireless transmission of power", International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, May 2013. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061512006308

### What can be anticipated?

Some quite cool.
